# PROJECT-ULTRON List of valid commands
As this whole project is all about Artificial Intelligence assistant(ULTRON), You must be able to talk and give commands to it. Here are some lists of commands that you must use to give commands. 
NOTE - As the AI was built on macintosh machine you will come across some path errors, and to adjust according to your machine you need to adjust it.
NOTE - Do note that, For opening applications you need to adjust :-

# Ultron Open applications Function
# def is_valid_open_launch(open_launch_dict, voice_note):
# for key, value in open_launch_dict.items():
# if value == voice_note.split(' ')[0]:
# return True
# break
# return False


To begin with list of commands we have:
1. ['Hello', 'Hi'] for greeting ULTRON.
2. ['Open'] for opening applications.
3. ['what', 'why, 'who, 'which', 'when'] can be used to ask quetions and ULTRON will google search it for you.
4. ['Thank you', 'Thank You ULTRON'] for thanking ULTRON for it's help.
5. ['how were you born'] to get to know how it was born.
6. ['Bye'] for quiting conversation with Ultron.

That are the commands for CBSE boards. More to come for sure.
